Bioinformatic pipelines are often included in Risk analysis created by the Laboratory, which are often in control of a laboratory specialist. The risk management of the laboratory does often not include regulare updates of bioinformatic pipelines or tools. Within each release, there could be new risks introduced, risks can be changed, or the risk mitigation measure can change. Risk management of software could be either updating risks with each release. There could be a software release form, where there is a section about risks. Where one could elaborate on risk analysis, and only include risks in the laboratories risk analysius table when the risk is persistent / noteworthy whatever. This way, small risks that are immediately mitigated, or for which subsequent tests are written do not need to appear in a list. from IEC-62304 The MANUFACTURER shall include or reference in the software development plan, a plan to conduct the ACTIVITIES and TASKS of the software RISK MANAGEMENT PROCESS, including the management of RISKS relating to SOUP.
